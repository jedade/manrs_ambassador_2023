## Project Overview

The aim of this tool is to be able to have the supply chain of an ASN
belonging to a category and a country and to check the routing security
status of each of the ASNs. This development will take place in
two phases:
● Creation of a script with these different functions:
Input: country, output: list ofASNs
Input: country, output: list of categories
Input: ASN, output:list of
siblings
input: ASN, output: list of providers/peers
input: ASN, output: MANRS metrics
● Presentation by a platform of
the information processed by the script on a web page with
graphics.
